Sorting                 Uncover some structure by sorting the input
Recursion               If the structure of the input is defined in a recursive manner, design a recursive algorithm
                        that follows the input definition
Divide&Conquer          Divide the problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems and solve the original problem
                        using solutions to the subproblems
Dynamic Programming     Compute solutions for smaller instances of a given problem and use these solutions to construct a solution to the problem. Cache for performance
Greedy algorithms       Compute a solution in stages, making choices that are locally optimum at step, these choices are never undone
Invariants              Identify an invariant and use it to rule out potential solutions that are suboptimal/dominated by other solutions.
